- Natural Language Processing: Processes movie overviews and tags using lemmatization.
- Cosine Similarity: Calculates similarity between movies using vector representations.
- Fuzzy Matching: Accepts approximate movie titles and finds the closest match.
- Graphical User Interface: Easy-to-use GUI built with Tkinter.
- Instant Recommendations: Get movie suggestions instantly upon entering a movie name or pressing Enter.

# 🚀 Technologies Used
